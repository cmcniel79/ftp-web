    These variables are available in global scope through ":root"

    overwrite each other if CSS Properties' (PostCSS plugin)
    configuration "preserve: true" is used - meaning that variables
    are left to CSS bundle. We are planning to enable it in the future
    since browsers support CSS Properties already.
