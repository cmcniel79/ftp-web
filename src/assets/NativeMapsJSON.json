French explorer Jacques Marquette was the first European to reach the Wisconsin River, arriving in 1673 and calling the river Meskousing  in his journal. Subsequent French writers changed the spelling from Meskousing to Ouisconsin, and over time this became the name for both the Wisconsin River and the surrounding lands. English speakers anglicized the spelling from Ouisconsin to Wisconsin when they began to arrive in large numbers during the early 19th century. \n\nThe Algonquian word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure. While interpretations vary, most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks. One leading theory holds that the name originated from the Miami word Meskonsing, meaning \"it lies red\", a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the Wisconsin Dells.[17] Other theories include claims that the name originated from one of a variety of Ojibwa words meaning \"red stone place\", \"where the waters gather\", or \"great rock\".[18] ",
